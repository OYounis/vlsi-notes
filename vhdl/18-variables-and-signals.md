## Signals vs variables
   - Signals are real physical electrical nodes in a circuit
   - Variable is a temporary storage location that exists only within a process

## variable usage
   - Useful in multiport memory, loops, counters
   - Should be careful about how they are used, and should be aware of what they synthesize into
   - They can be initialized to an initial value in the first process call, then they update their value each process call
   - There is also global variables
   - Unlike signals variables update immediately after they are assigned, they donâ€™t get scheduled to update at the end of the process, there is no distinction between transactions and events in variables
   - A signal assignment is a transaction, and it becomes an actual change or an event when we meet a wait statement
